    "Most of these operators are very straightforward and I don't think they require any explanation. I will go over the modulus and floor division operator as these are less common. One small note on division, however. We can see that the division operation returns a float, instead of an integer. This makes intuitive sense, but we did get a different data type back compared to what we put into the expression. This is due to python always returning floats when performing division as the quotient of a division is often not an integer. Keep this in mind when performing division with integers, or perform floor division if you do not care about what's after the decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floor division, also called integer division, performs a division on both the integers given and rounds down the decimal so that the result will be an integer. In this case, with normal division, `5 // 2` would result in `2.5`. With floor division, this gets rounded down to `2`. It is important to note that this function will always round down, you can think of this as just removing any numbers after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulus operation returns the remainder after division. In the case of integers we first perform floor division to determine how many times the divisor fits into the dividend. In this case, two times as the result of `5 // 2` is `2`. This means that `1` is left over after we subtract the divider multiplied by the result of the floor division. For floats this works the same way, except normal division is used instead of floor division."

    "## Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators refer to the collection of operators used to create or update an assignment to a variable. You already are familiar with the most important one `=`. This assigns the value to a new variable or overwrites the existing value. The assignment operators can often be combined with the arithmetic operators as a shorthand for writing the full expression. For example, `x += 1` will add one to the value assigned to `x` and updates `x` to reflect the new value. This is a shorthand for `x = x + 1`. Depending on you preferred coding style and the required clarity of the code you may always opt to write out the full expression if it's clearer to the reader of the code. Below are some of the most common assignment operators. There are more, but I will cover those at the end of the chapter once I've explained the base operators of these.\n"
