    "\n",
    "If statements are used to check for a condition and to run code contained within them conditionally. There are three parts that can be included in the statement, but only the `if` keyword is mandatory. The other two are the `else` condition, which gets executed if the condition does not match, and the `elif` condition which are other possible conditions if the first one is not a match straight away. Conditions are evaluated from top to bottom and once a condition matches, no conditions are further evaluated. Below is a very barebones example of an if statement."

Let's look at a couple of loop examples below. We will also introduce the range function which makes it easy to create a sequence of numbers to use for indexing."

After this, it will stop running and leave the loop. Of special note is `while True:`. This is known as an infinite loop. Since the condition always evaluates to true and there is no way to change it, the loop will keep running forever. Let's look at a few examples with while loops."
