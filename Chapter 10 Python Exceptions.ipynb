    "## Stacktraces\n",
    "Sometimes, the code does something unexpected. Maybe you are trying to load a file that does not exist, or somehow you start dividing by zero. At this point, Python will start to 'throw' exceptions and the program will stop. This is not ideal, as often you want the program to keep working on other things it needs to do. This is where python exceptions and error handling come in. Let's look at an exception:"

This is why above the error, a so called 'Stack trace' is printed. This is a traceback through the code to see where it has failed. Often this takes you into the internals of Python itself. The best way to start debugging this is to look at the parts of the stacktrace that you have written yourself and start from there. In this case, as the problem is very straight forward, we have a short stacktrace immediately pointing to the line where we divide by zero. Let's see what happens if the code is not directly in the notebook but in another package. In this case the `my_divide_by_zero` function in `my_package`.",

    "We still get the same error but now the stacktrace is much longer already. The top part points to the cell where it has gone wrong. This is always the first step in the stacktrace and usually where you want to begin looking for problems. This line is not the issue in this case, however, and we need to read further down to get to the root cause of the error. You can see from the stacktrace that points to the `return` line in the function in the package. It even shows that it occurs in line 67 of the `module.py`. Reading stacktraces requires some getting used to, but is invaluable for debugging your code quickly. At the time of writing, newer Python versions are actively working on improving the information in the error messages, going as far as to give suggestions as to what might have gone wrong. In this tutorial I have opted to use an older python version as these are more wide-spread, and thus you will see these stacktraces more often. Think of it like this: If you can read these stacktraces, it will only become easier in the future when the information in them improves.\n",

    "Enough about creating and interpreting errors now. What if we actually want to deal with them? In Python, we use the `try` and `except` keywords for this. Everything in the `try` block will be run, and if an error occurs the specific exception will be 'caught' by the `except` statement and the code in that block will be executed. Let's catch the `ZeroDivisionError` we have seen before."
