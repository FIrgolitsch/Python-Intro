    "# Chapter 4: Python Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will cover the various collections in Python, their properties and how to work with them. These collections are used widely within python and can be used to represent complex data structures. That being said, often these collections are replaced in favour of more specialised collection types such as numeric arrays with the NumPy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start I would like to make a small comment on how the indices of python collections work. Indexing in python always starts at 0. This means if you want to retrieve the first item of list, you would ask the collection for the item at index 0. Keep this in mind during this chapter. This will pop up again and again in most programming languages, with only a handful of exceptions."

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The lists are the most basic type of collection in Python. This collection can hold any item, and does not care about maintaining the same datatype within the list. As mentioned in chapter 2, lists are mutable. This means that the contents of the variable can be modified without updating the reference. This is true for most collections, with a few exceptions which will be mentioned in this chapter. Bellow are an overview of the most common functions that can be used to create and modify lists, as well as a couple of utility function that help with working with the items inside the list."

This means that is for example not possible to use other collections, with few exceptions, as keys in the dictionary. A few options which are available to lists are not present for dictionaries. These are functions which have to do with the order the elements appear in. Dictionaries cannot be sorted as there is no order to the elements inside them. As such, they can also not be reversed.  Below is a demonstration of how to use them."

We will look at such options in the next chapter. These objects are so called 'view' objects.

This means that no set will contain duplicates and that there is no ordering in the elements in the set. Similarly to dictionaries, this means that the lists cannot be sorted or reversed. This also means, individual items in the set cannot be retrieved by an index. If you would try a similar approach as with lists by calling `x[0]` it will cause an error.
