    "In previous chapter we have discussed python modules, packages, and libraries. I introduced a package that I have created for this book and used some of its functions. There are a lot more libraries out there, however. Some of them will be covered the next couple chapters. In this chapter, I will introduce some of the tools that Python uses to manage all these libraries.\n",
