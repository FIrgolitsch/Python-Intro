I'll also introduce variables and how to work with them. This includes some theory on how the memory management work when you assign and update variables in Python."

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages variables are used to store data values. These data values could be anything like a number, a piece of text, or and entire book if you're ambitious. All these variables have a certain type associated with them. A number is defined as an integer for whole numbers and a float for decimal numbers. A piece of text is defined as a string. Python also has support for complex numbers by adding the `j` suffix to a number assignment. Let's look at some examples. Variables are assigned by using the `=` operator. The variable is on the left side of the operator and the value is on the right side. Let's look at some examples."

    "As we can see, x was assigned the integer value of 5 and y the float value 5.5. For the assignment of numbers we can just directly assign the number to the variable. For strings, we need to use quotation marks. This can be either single or double quotes. In the example above we used double quotes. Double quotes are more common, but single quotes work as well. Other programming langues might have a different interpretation of the quotes so always make sure you know what they do. For example, using single quotes in Java or C# means that you are assigning a single character instead of a full string. We don't see the type of the variables above however, as the `print(..)` statement neatly outputs all the variables as text. Let's see next how we can show the type of the variables. This is useful when you want to make sure that a variable is what you expect it to be. For example, `5` might be a float, an integer or a string and behaviour will change accordingly."

There are many different types in Python, and there's no way to cover all of them. You can even create your own by creating a class. For now, the term class and type mean the same thing. In the case of an integer for example, the class defines what to do when we use the '+' operator (addition): it adds the two numbers that you give. However, if your class is a string, the '+' will glue the two strings together. Classes are quite complex, and are more extensively covered in chapter 7. \n",
